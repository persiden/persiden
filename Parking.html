<b>Parking Regulations</b>   
<br>
All vehicle registrations must be made online at the Vehicle Registration Website. Permits will be mailed in accordance with instructions issued by the Parking Services Office. Please monitor the Vehicle Registration Web site for information regarding mailings or dates, time and location for permit pickup.
Every vehicle that is parked on campus must display a parking permit issued by the Parking Services Office. Student parking permit registration for the next academic year usually begins towards the end of the Spring semester.
Current student parking permits expire at the end of the summer semester. Parking permits may be purchased at any time during the year at the Parking Services Office during normal business hours.
<b>Parking Permit fees will increase each year to allow for construction of a Parking garage.</b>
			Details of the 4 year implementation plan are listed below.<br>

          </ul>
           
            
            <b>Payment for Vehicle Registration</b>
			<p>
				Students who register a vehicle will have the parking permit fee placed on their student account where it is added to other tuition and fees. This makes it possible for loans, 
                scholarships, and some types of financial aid to cover the cost of the vehicle registration.
			</p>
			<b>Multiple Vehicles</b>
			<p>
                Students may register more than one vehicle to a parking permit: however, only one vehicle is allowed on campus at any time displaying the permit. For commuters who will have more 
                than one car on campus at a time, a second parking permit for the additional vehicle must be purchased. For anyone who wishes to register more than one vehicle and intends to have 
                only one of the registered vehicles on campus at any given time, the parking permit may be moved from one vehicle to the other.
            </p>
            <b>Temporary Permits</b>
            <p>    
                Temporary Permits may be purchased for $7.50 per week. Temporary permits may be used when a temporary vehicle is brought to campus or when a motorist cannot pay the full-price for a 
                decal at the time of registration. Temporary permits must be purchased if a vehicle is to be on campus more than three days.
            </p>
            <b>Visitor’s Permits</b>
            <p>    
                Visitors are encouraged, but no required, to obtain a visitor parking permit when on campus. Visitors may park in student or faculty/staff spaces (white or yellow space) that are not 	
                designated as a special use space, reserved space, handicapped space, loading zone, etc. Normally, a visitor who receives a parking citation for no registration may have that citation
                waived by filling out the back of the citation and bringing by or mailing it to the Traffic Office (instructions are on the back of the citation). However visitors are expected to 
                abide by the parking rules and regulation and are accountable for paying the fines and /or appealing all other violations.
            </p>
            <b>Vehicle Registration Exceptions (Open Parking)</b>
            <p>    
                Vehicles parked in the academic area after 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and at any time on weekends or University holidays are not required to display a parking permit. Any student who 
                chooses not to register their vehicle and finds that they must park on campus on a weekday before 5:00 p.m. to use the library, visit the Bookstore, or take care of other business 
                must have the vehicle registered. Unregistered vehicles operated by students will be cited for non-registration. This exception does not apply to parking at the residence halls. All 
                vehicles at the residence halls must be registered at all times. Resident students who anticipate visiting parents or other non-university affiliated visitors should obtain a 
                visitor’s pass for their vehicle.
            </p>
            <b>Unregistered Vehicles</b>
            <p>    
                When unregistered vehicles receive citations, the owners of the vehicle are identified through computerized links with motor vehicle offices in all 50 states. If the owner is 
                identified as a student or a member of such person’s family, the fines are applied to the individual account.
            </p>
            <b>Trading Cars</b>
            <p>
                If a student trades his or her registered vehicle for another vehicle, he or she must provide the Parking Services Office staff with the information on the vehicles so that the 
                registration records may be updated.
            </p>
            <b>Lost or Stolen Permits</b>
            <p>
                Report all lost or stolen parking permits to the Parking Services. Lost or stolen permits must be replaced for $10.00. University Police will investigate all thefts, prosecute 
                offenders where possible, and assist the victim in recovering the cost of the stolen permit. Individuals who recover parking permits that may be lost or stolen must submit them to the
                Parking Services Office.
                Anyone found displaying a lost or stolen parking permit is subject to having their vehicle wheel-locked or towed and/or criminal charges.
            </p>
            <b>Where to Park</b>
            <p>
                Generally, yellow stripes denote spaces for faculty and staff members: white striped spaces are for students. White striped spaces near the residence halls are for resident students. 
                Freshman must park in the freshman/overflow lots. Be sure to observe parking control signs designating other restrictions in these categories. All faculty/staff areas are designated 
                as wheel-lock/tow zones during business hours including fall and Spring breaks. Students are not allowed to park in these areas except between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. during the week,
                on weekends, or official University holidays.
            </p>
            <b>COMMUTERS</b>
            <p>
                In addition to designated commuter parking area, commuters may also park in the freshman lots. When a change in driver’s official status occurs (a resident student officially moves 
                off campus or a commuter student officially moves onto campus), the permit should be exchanged for the correct permit.
            </p>
            <b>RESIDENTS</b>
            <p>
                A resident student for parking purposes is an upperclassman that lives in the residence halls. To be considered upper class you must have 30 earned hours. 
                Upper class resident students may park in the white-lined spaces at the residence halls at any time. They may not park in the academic area between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Resident 
                students are expected to walk to class. Upperclassman resident students may park in faculty/staff spaces or commuter spaces in the academic areas from 5:00 p.m.to 7:00 a.m. during the
                week, on weekends, and on official University holidays. Resident students may also park in overflow spaces in the freshman lots. When a change in a drivers’ official status occurs the
                student must return their permit to the parking services office.  The student will be issued the correct permit for their new status. 
            </p>
            <b>FRESHMEN</b>
            <p>
                A freshman student for parking purposes is an entering student who has not completed his or her first year at Western Carolina University and who has not earned 30 credit hours. 
                Freshmen must park in the freshmen/overflow lots most of the time. Residence hall freshmen are allowed to park at the residence halls from 5:00 p.m. on Fridays until 8:00 p.m. on 
                Sundays. When a change in a drivers official status occurs (a resident student officially moves off campus or a commuter student officially moves onto campus), the permit should 
                exchanged for the correct permit. 
            </p>
            <b>WESTERN STUDENTS WITH CLASSES AT UNC-ASHEVILLE</b>
            <p>    
                Students who have all of their classes at UNC-Asheville must purchase a UNCA decal. Western Carolina University honor UNCA decals in the proper zones at WCU. For instance, a graduate 
                student at UNCA with a student decal must park in a student space when on campus at Western Carolina.
                When a change in a driver official status occurs (a resident student officially moves off campus or a commuter student officially moves onto campus), the student must return the old 
                permit. A new permit will be issued to reflect the new status. 
            </p>
            <b>SHUTTLE SERVICE</b>
            <p>
                The University Shuttle is sponsored by the University Police and is supported from student fees. It runs from the outlying lots to several campus locations every fifteen minutes.
