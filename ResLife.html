          	The Western Carolina University Department of Residential Living Welcomes You.  It is our hope to provide some information to make your college experience a positive one. We have tried to anticipate some questions you may have concerning our services, facilities, and programs. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact us. We want you to know that we are dedicated to making the college experience an integral part of your personal growth and development. Again, welcome to residence hall living at Western Carolina University.<br>

            <br>
		  <h3><strong>What is Western Carolina PEAKS?</strong></h3>
            Western Carolina PEAKS is the first year experience program at WCU. This program is designed to make the transition to college life easier and more successful for first-year students.  All first year students are considered to be a part of this program, with most students living together in Albright-Benton, Scott, or Walker Hall and taking part in special programming geared to introduce the student to Western Carolina University and prepare for issues that are typically experienced by first-year college students nationwide. Our goal is to connect students with each other, with faculty and staff, and with resources that will help ease their transition to WCU.<br>
			<br>
			<h3><strong>What is a Resident Assistant (RA)? Does every floor have one?</strong></h3>
            Resident Assistants are undergraduate students who live on each floor in your Residence Hall.  They have gone through special training which will enable them to assist you with your transition into college.  Some of the things you can expect your RA to do include providing you with education and social programming opportunities, ensuring that people are following university policies, assisting with roommate concerns, and being available should you need assistance.<br>
			<br>
			<h3><strong>Where can I go if I have questions? </strong></h3>
            Residence hall offices are staffed each day by residence life staff, Resident Assistants, or Assistant Resident Directors. If you need assistance, stop by your hall office during the posted hours or call your RA, Assistant Resident Director, or Resident Director. Residential Living staff members are available at other times in their rooms.  Staffing lists for each building will be posted with names and phone numbers for your information and use. <br>
			<br>
			<h3><strong>How do I get mail at Western Carolina University?  </strong></h3>
            United States mail is collected and distributed through the Student Mail Center, located in Hinds University Center, Monday through Friday, and delivered to each residentâ€™s mailbox before 1:00 p.m.  During your first week on campus, you should stop by the Mail Center to receive your mail-box key. To ensure that your mail reaches you as quickly as possible, make sure that correspondents have your correct address and zip code.  This is the proper residence hall address:
            <center><table>
            	<tr>
                	<td>         </td><td>Your Name<br>
 							Western Carolina University<br>
 							245 Memorial Drive<br>
 							Suite __________ <br>
							Cullowhee, NC 28723 </td><td></td>
                </tr>
            </table></center><br>
            If you have a mail problem, speak with someone in the Mail Center between 10:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.  Please note that mail is not delivered to the individual boxes during the summer.  Students may pick up their mail from the Mail Center during designated times.   <br>
<br>
UPS/Federal Express and most USPS packages, including insured or Priority Mail, should be picked up at the Mail Center between 10:30 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. In all cases, proper student identification must be shown. <br>
<br>
You will receive e-mail notification, via your WCU e-mail account, for any packages received in the Student Mail Center. Therefore, it will be your responsibility to check your WCU account regularly. <br>
<br>
When checking out of the residence hall, please complete a Mail-Forwarding Address Card to en-sure your mail is forwarded to you. You will also need to return your mailbox key to the Mail Center in order to avoid any key replacement charge.<br>
<br>
			<h3><strong>Room/Roommate/Building Changes </strong></h3>
            Room, roommate, or building changes can take place for two weeks beginning August 24, 2015, during the fall semester and January 19, 2016, during the spring semester. This waiting period is necessary in order for Residential Living to verify which students have returned for the semester.  If it is evident that you and your roommate cannot live together peacefully, you should contact a hall staff member, who will assist in facilitating a mediation process between you and your roommate. If the mediation process is unsuccessful, you may request a room change through our online system. <br>
<br>
Residents who are changing rooms must officially check out of the current room and residence hall, if changing buildings, and check into the new room.  Any questions about the moving process should be directed to your Resident Director, Graduate Community Coordinator, or Assistant Director for Residence Life. <br>
<br>
Students who are housed in Freshmen Halls (Walker, Scott, and Albright/Benton) will only be permitted to make room changes within and between these three buildings.<br>
